/**
 * The rules behind `scripts/check-god-files.ts`.
 *
 * Provenance: converged from the seven `.mjs` copies (AWS-AccessBridge,
 * CalDAV-Bridge, ChordDHT-Tracker, Durable-DAV, Durable-DAV-Router, Edge-Git,
 * Mail-Meow, Mail-Otter) and the typed ratchet in Edge-Sonic.
 *
 * All seven `.mjs` copies are one script with two constants: soft 300 (warn),
 * hard 400 (error). The typed variant is not a different rule so much as a
 * different answer to "what does the gate enforce", and that is the decision this
 * module has to take once for the whole family.
 *
 * ### The convergence: warn-only, with an allowlist
 *
 * The two source designs:
 *
 * - **Ceiling** (six repos) — 300 warn, 400 error, `exit 1` on 400. Durable-DAV's
 *   own `AGENTS.md` records what that measures: **ten** files sit just over 300
 *   and none is a god file, so `WARN` reports every run and `HARD` has never
 *   fired. A ceiling set above the largest file in the tree cannot tell a
 *   repository getting worse from one that never got better, and raising it is
 *   always available.
 * - **Ratchet** (Edge-Sonic) — a committed baseline records every file's size; a
 *   file may shrink freely and grow only to its recorded size. It cannot be
 *   satisfied by raising a number, which is its whole strength.
 *
 * The ratchet is the better *rule*, and the ceiling is the better *gate*: the
 * ratchet needs a baseline maintained per file and fails the first time somebody
 * writes a legitimate 320-line module, which is the failure mode that trains
 * everyone to ignore a report. So the converged script keeps the 300/400
 * thresholds — every repo's CI already prints them — and makes the verdict
 * **warn-only by default**, with two escape valves that are both visible in a
 * diff:
 *
 * 1. `--fail-on-hard` turns the 400 line back into a failing gate, for a repo
 *   that has paid its debt and wants the ceiling enforced.
 * 2. An **allowlist** records the files that are over the line and known, so the
 *   report names only the ones that are *new*. That is the ratchet's
 *   "recorded size" idea without its per-file bookkeeping: the allowlist is
 *   reviewed by the same commit that grows the file, because the diff shows what
 *   was added to it.
 *
 * Tests are excluded, as every source does. A double modelling the platform grows
 * with the platform's surface, not with the complexity of the code it stands in
 * for — Edge-Sonic's ratchet holds them too, and its own notes record a 4,343-line
 * fixture, so this is a documented disagreement rather than an oversight.
