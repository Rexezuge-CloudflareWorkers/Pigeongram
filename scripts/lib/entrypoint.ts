/**
 * Whether this module is the process's entrypoint.
 *
 * The comparison needs **both** sides resolved through `realpathSync`, and that
 * is not a detail. `process.argv[1]` is whatever the caller typed — under pnpm
 * that is `node_modules/@rexezuge/tooling/dist/scripts/…`, a **symlink** into the
 * store — while `import.meta.url` is always the realpath, because the ESM
 * resolver follows links. So the two never matched, the guard never fired, and
 * every script below exited 0 having printed nothing.
 *
 * That is the worst shape a gate can fail in: it looks green. `check-god-files`
 * reported no file over the limit for every repository that adopted it,
 * `validate-locales` passed with a key missing from eleven bundles, and neither
 * said a word. Found by AWS-AccessBridge swapping in its own `validate_locales`
 * and finding that the replacement stopped catching the defect the old one
 * reported on the same tree.
 *
 * It is worth a function rather than an inline comparison because four scripts
 * carry the same guard, and a shared helper is what makes the fifth correct
 * instead of a fourth copy of the same mistake.
 *
 * A missing or unreadable entrypoint is not the entrypoint, and the caller
 * exports the rule functions precisely so the module stays importable — a suite
 * imports these to test the rules, and there `process.argv[1]` is the test file.
